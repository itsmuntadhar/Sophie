Human fall detection device

# About

Project Sophie was one of my mini-projects during my senior year of EE in UoK (2017/18).
It's a wearable device to detect if the user has fallen to notify through a centeral receiver.

# Technical Details

The transmitter or the wearable use gyroscope to detect, then transmits a signal through 433MHz transmitter with a device-unique ID to a receiver that in turn will activate alarms and send an SMS to a predefined phone number.

# TODO

* Flexibility in phone number(s) modification
